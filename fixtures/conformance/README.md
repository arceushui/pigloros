# Public conformance fixture sources

These files are the public, deterministic inputs and expected-result records
for the seven CPF1 claim layers. They contain no implementation-private state,
credentials, or signing material.

The immutable bundle boundary in `pos-conformance` accepts these bytes from a
caller, recomputes each BLAKE3 content address, binds the CPF1 profile digest,
and signs only the canonical manifest. Local and Air-Gapped manifests must be
materialized separately with the same expected-result records; the Air-Gapped
profile capability policy remains network-deny.

The scenario names intentionally cover positive, negative, malformed, resource
limit, deletion, downgrade, and independent-evaluation cases.
